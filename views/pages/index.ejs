        "The advice I like to give young artists, or really anybody who'll
        listen to me, is not to wait around for inspiration. Inspiration is for
        amateurs; the rest of us just show up and get to work. If you wait
        around for the clouds to part and a bolt of lightning to strike you in
        the brain, you are not going to make an awful lot of work. All the best
        ideas come out of the process; they come out of the work itself. Things
        occur to you. If you're sitting around trying to dream up a great art
        idea, you can sit there a long time before anything happens. But if you
        just get to work, something will occur to you and something else will
        occur to you and something else that you reject will push you in another
        direction. Inspiration is absolutely unnecessary and somehow deceptive.
        You feel like you need this great idea before you can get down to work,
        and I find that's almost never the case."</quote
